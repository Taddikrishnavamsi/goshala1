# TODO: Hide Carousel Arrows on Mobile

## Tasks
- [x] Add CSS media query to hide #prev-button and #next-button on mobile screens (max-width: 768px)
- [x] Verify swipe functionality remains intact on mobile (no JS changes made, swipe should work if implemented)
- [ ] Test the changes on a mobile device or emulator

## Files to Edit
- public/style.css: Add media query to hide carousel arrows on mobile

## Notes
- Arrows are currently visible on hover/focus on desktop
- Swipe functionality is handled by JavaScript and should not be affected
